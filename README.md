# Students Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to identify key factors influencing academic success.  
It is structured into three main stages:

1. **Data Cleaning** – Preparing the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing data distributions, exploring relationships between variables, and uncovering trends.
3. **Insights & Conclusions** – Summarizing findings from the EDA and providing interpretations.
